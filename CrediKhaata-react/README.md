     ```
     VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
     VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
     VITE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
     VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
     VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
     VITE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
     VITE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
     ```

3. **Common variables**:
   - `VITE_API_KEY`: Your Firebase API key.
   - `VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN`: Your Firebase authentication domain.
